# Intro to the World of Software Engineering

Hello, World.

## A Simple Beginning

Did you know? Life began when someone decided to create a computer-based information system. Yes, at least the life that we are having today. Nowadays, these systems have become so essential to our lives that we’ve even designed them to fit inside our pockets.

This computer-based info system consists of two or more elements, but as an introduction, there are two elements that are very important to know about.

## Hardware

Hardware is the physical and tangible part of a computer.  
It processes data by following instructions, stores information, and sends or receives data through input and output devices.

## Software

Software is the non physical part of a computer.  
It presents data to the user, manages how information is accessed, and controls how the machine behaves.

## Working Together

Hardware and software support each other. They determine what a computer does, how it operates, where data moves, and when tasks happen. These two elements form the foundation of Software Engineering.

If you want to explore this field further, you first need to understand the nature of these systems and how each part contributes to the whole.

Your journey begins here.
