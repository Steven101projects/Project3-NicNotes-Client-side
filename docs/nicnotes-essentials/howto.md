# How to be Software Engineer?

## Understanding Input, Process, Output — And the Rise of Digital Networks

While thinking about the nature of software, you start to wonder: **what do you actually need to understand to become a software engineer?**

On the previous page, we introduced a very common idea in computing: **Input and Output**.  
You will see this everywhere in programming, system design, and real-world software architecture.

To understand it more clearly, let us take a deeper look at how the computer processes data.

## The IPO Model

In Figure 1, you saw how information flows inside a computer. This flow is usually described using the **IPO model**: Input → Process → Output.

### **Input**
Data or variables received by a program.  
This can come from:

- a user typing values  
- a sensor reading  
- a file imported from storage  
- a network request  
- a database retrieval  

Input is simply **the starting point** of everything a program does.

### **Process**
A sequence of instructions that manipulate the input.  
The process stage may include:

- calculations  
- comparisons  
- data conversion  
- validation  
- decision-making  
- updating values in storage  

The process is where the “thinking” of the software happens.

### **Output**
The result of the processed input.  
This might appear as:

- text on a screen  
- a saved file  
- a sent message  
- a result stored in a database  
- a response returned to another system  

Output is what the user or system sees as the final outcome.

Knowing the IPO model is a fundamental skill for software engineers. It keeps your thinking simple and prevents overcomplicating how a program works. Every system — small or large — can be broken down into these three stages.

But then something changed the world of software forever.

# The Rise of the Digital Network

When the internet took over, software no longer lived alone on a single machine.  
Systems needed a way to talk to each other.

This added a new dimension to software engineering.

## What is a Digital Network?

A **digital network** is a system that allows computers to communicate by sending data using standardized rules called protocols.  
This happens through digital mediums such as:

- Wi-Fi  
- Mobile data  
- Bluetooth  
- Ethernet cables  
- Satellite signals  
- File sharing environments  
- Cloud platforms  

Because of this, millions of computers can stay connected and exchange information across the world.

### Digital Network (Simple Definition)
A digital network enables computer systems to share data with one another through protocols and communication standards.

The I/O principle still applies — a device may send data (output) and another may receive it (input) — but there is a **new layer** involved.

# The Network Layer

This layer ties everything together.  
When data travels between devices, the network layer decides:

- **where** the data should go  
- **how** it gets there  
- **how to split large data into packets**  
- **how to handle delays or failures**  
- **how devices identify each other on the network**  

Every time you refresh a website, message someone, or save to cloud storage, the network layer is quietly doing the heavy lifting.

# Extending IPO Into Modern Contexts

To understand how software works today, here are additional contexts where IPO and networking merge.

## 1. Web Applications
A user sends input through a browser →  
A server processes it →  
The browser receives and displays the output.

Example:  
Submitting a login form.

## 2. Mobile Apps
Touch input →  
App logic processes it →  
Phone displays results or sends updates to cloud servers.

Example:  
Refreshing a social media feed.

## 3. Internet of Things (IoT)
Sensors collect input →  
Microcontrollers process data →  
Outputs control devices or upload readings to the cloud.

Example:  
Smart thermostats adjusting temperature automatically.

## 4. Cloud Computing
Your device provides input →  
Remote servers process data →  
Output is returned instantly across the network.

Example:  
Streaming platforms, cloud storage, AI tools.

## 5. Distributed Systems
Multiple machines share the process layer.  
Some systems input data, others process it, and others deliver the output.

Example:  
Online multiplayer games, banking systems, large e-commerce platforms.

# Final Thoughts for This Page

If Page 2 introduced *what* software is, this page introduces *how* software behaves in the real world.

The IPO model teaches you how a program thinks.  
The Digital Network teaches you how programs communicate.  
Together, they build the foundation for everything you will design as a software engineer.

Next question:  
**If you understand these layers, how do you start building software that uses them effectively?**
