# The Nature of Software Engineering

Software Engineering has become a huge field in recent decades, but we are not here to learn history, are we? I got you.

## What is Software in the Real World

Most commonly called a program, a computer software is a set of instructions executed by the hardware to perform specific tasks.

### Here are **7 broad types of computer software**:
**System Software:** O.S., compilers, file management programs
**System Software:**  
O.S., compilers, file management programs

**Application Software:**  
Chrome, Spotify, MSTeams

**Engineering and Scientific Software:**  
Calculators, simulation tools

**Embedded Software:**  
Keypads, car automation systems, digital laundry controls

**Product Line Software:**  
Company specific applications like McDonalds POS systems

**Web Applications:**  
Online websites, sometimes mobile apps

**Artificial Intelligence Software:**  
ChatGPT, machine learning models

**Bonus — The OGs:**  
Legacy software such as Windows XP or mainframe systems

Now that you have an idea of what software is, let us talk about it further.

## The Nature of Software Engineering

The nature of Software Engineering can be defined on three ideas:

:::important _
# COMPOSITION | DATA | DELIVERY
These are the three core ideas that define the nature of Software Engineering.

If you are a well versed user reading this, forget what you know about software for a moment and let these ideas flow through your mind.

## Composition

All software depends on its composition.

A poorly structured software feels like a house that is unfinished or built in a rush.

**So, what is composition in Software Engineering?**  
It is how your software is planned and built.  
It is about asking the right questions, creating a design, and understanding why the software needs to exist.

In every stage of software engineering, composition appears again and again.

A good composition creates software that is fast, efficient, and adaptable in all its parts.

## Data

Secondly, there is **DATA**.  
The life of a software itself.

Does software survive without data. Yes, but a software without data does not have any purpose.

Data can be anything:

- a source  
- an output  
- a variable  
- an object  
- any element  

To have good data means designing software that uses data intentionally and allows it to be managed and manipulated easily.

Data is the most important of the three. Without it, the other two would not make sense.

---

## Delivery

Last of all three is **DELIVERY**.  
This is where most of the demand in Software Engineering lies.

This is often what your client will care about the most.

A good delivery means software that is shareable, user friendly, and accessible to as many people as possible.

## Summary

To sum it all up, the nature of Software Engineering is about:

- wise composition  
- a polished use of data  
- a smooth and masterful delivery  

To make good software, keep them in mind.

:::note
Do not sweat it when you are working on a software project. Keep these three key ideas in your pocket and let them do the heavy lifting.

Now that you know the nature of it, and you are like a tiger tamer that wants to do good at your job, how do you become a good tamer.
