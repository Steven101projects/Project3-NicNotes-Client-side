# Introduction;

Hi! If you are here, you are probably wondering **What is the purpose of this?**

This is **NicNotes** by Nico Castro, a 19-year old Web Developer, and a recent Software Engineering Technician Student. I created this website to put all my notes i have written all about my past program. All I think about when I started studying this field is to put all my thoughts with it, so not only will I have tutorials, or documentation of what i have learned about Software Engineeering, I will also put my own thoughts and understanding to it by explaining it all a little bit differently.


**Anyways, if you find this interesting, go and start your journey now!**
