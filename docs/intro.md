# Introduction

Hi! Welcome to **NicNotes.**

If you are here, you are probably curious about what this site is meant to do. The idea is simple. **I wanted a place where I could gather everything I learned in my program and turn it into something useful for myself and anyone else who is studying the same subjects.**

My name is **Nico Castro**. I am a nineteen year old web developer and a recent Software Engineering Technician student. While I was studying, I realized I kept writing notes in many different places. I wanted one place that felt like a personal hub for all my lessons, my reflections, and my own explanations. That is how NicNotes started.

:::tip ?
 Here you will find tutorials, guides, documentation, and my own way of explaining the concepts that helped me grow as a developer. I try to keep things clear, direct, and practical. If you enjoy learning through someone else's point of view, you might find this helpful.
